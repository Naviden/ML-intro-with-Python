# Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to our repository designed to teach Machine Learning (ML) using Python, focusing on regression models. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for learners at all levels interested in understanding and applying regression techniques in machine learning.

### Topics Covered
- **Understanding Regression in Machine Learning:** Introduction to the concept of regression, its purpose, and types.
- **Boston Housing Dataset Overview:** Exploration and understanding of the dataset used for regression models.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for loading, understanding, and normalizing data.
- **Modeling Techniques:** Detailed explanations and implementations of various regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Discussion on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared (R^2).
- **Model Optimization:** Deep dive into optimization techniques including Grid Search and Random Search, their applications, advantages, and considerations in model selection.

### Activities Included
- **Data Loading:** Techniques to load data for analysis and modeling.
- **Data Splitting:** Methods to split data into training and testing sets.
- **Data Normalization:** Steps for normalizing data to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** Instructions on how to train different types of regression models.
- **Model Prediction:** Demonstrations of making predictions using trained models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Guidelines for evaluating model performance using various metrics.
- **Data Visualization:** Techniques for visualizing data and model performance.
- **Grid Search and Random Search:** Implementation and explanation of these optimization techniques to fine-tune model parameters.

### Theoretical Foundations
Throughout the notebook, we provide theoretical insights necessary for a deep understanding of the concepts at hand. These sections are designed to supplement the hands-on exercises with a solid theoretical background. It's recommended that learners have a basic familiarity with machine learning concepts before diving into these sections, to fully benefit from the explanations.
