Decision trees are a popular supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They model decisions as a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature (or attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome or class label.

#### How It Works:

1. **Splitting Data:**
   - Decision trees start by evaluating the entire dataset and selecting the best feature to split on.
   - The goal of splitting is to maximize the homogeneity (or purity) of the resulting subsets.
   - Common metrics for measuring homogeneity include Gini impurity and entropy.

2. **Building the Tree:**
   - After the initial split, the process is repeated recursively for each subset (or branch).
   - At each step, the algorithm selects the best feature to split on based on the chosen metric.
   - This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth or having subsets with pure class labels.

3. **Making Predictions:**
   - To make predictions for a new instance, the algorithm traverses the tree from the root node to a leaf node.
   - At each internal node, it follows the decision rule based on the value of the corresponding feature.
   - Once it reaches a leaf node, the predicted outcome (class label for classification or numerical value for regression) is determined.

#### Key Points:

- Decision trees partition the feature space into regions based on simple decision rules.
- They are interpretable and easy to visualize, making them useful for understanding and explaining decision-making processes.
- Decision trees can handle both numerical and categorical features.
- They are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree grows too deep. Techniques like pruning can be used to prevent overfitting.
- Decision trees are often used as the building blocks for more complex ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.
