Random Forest is a popular ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

#### How It Works:

1. **Building Multiple Trees:**
   - Random Forest builds a collection of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data.
   - The randomness comes from two sources:
     - **Bootstrap Sampling:** Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the original dataset. Bootstrap sampling involves randomly selecting samples from the dataset with replacement.
     - **Feature Randomization:** At each node of the tree, a random subset of features is considered for splitting. This helps in decorrelating the trees.

2. **Voting or Averaging:**
   - For classification tasks, each tree in the forest predicts the class label of a new instance, and the class that receives the most votes (mode) among all trees is chosen as the final prediction.
   - For regression tasks, the predictions of all trees are averaged to obtain the final prediction.

3. **Reducing Overfitting:**
   - Random Forest reduces overfitting by averaging the predictions of multiple trees.
   - Additionally, by training each tree on a random subset of the data and considering only a subset of features at each split, it introduces diversity among the trees, which helps in generalization.

#### Key Points:

- Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions.
- It introduces randomness in the training process through bootstrap sampling and feature randomization to reduce overfitting.
- Random Forest is robust to noisy data and tends to generalize well.
- It can handle large datasets with high dimensionality.
- Random Forest is less interpretable compared to individual decision trees but still provides insights into feature importance.
