Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a variant of linear regression that introduces a penalty term to the standard least squares objective function. It is particularly useful for feature selection and when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.

#### How It Works:

1. **Objective Function:**
   - Lasso Regression modifies the standard linear regression objective function by adding a regularization term, also known as the Lasso penalty or L1 penalty.
   - The objective function for Lasso Regression is given by:
     $$\text{minimize } J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\theta_j|$$
     where:
     - $J(\theta)$ is the cost function to be minimized.
     - $\theta_j$ are the regression coefficients.
     - $\hat{y}_i$ are the predicted values.
     - $\alpha$ is the regularization parameter (also known as the Lasso parameter).
     - The second term is the regularization term, penalizing the absolute values of the coefficients $|\theta_j|$.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Lasso Regression encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector by driving some coefficients to exactly zero.
   - This property makes Lasso Regression useful for feature selection, as it automatically selects the most important features while setting the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero.
   - The choice of $\alpha$ determines the level of sparsity in the model.

3. **Shrinkage Effect:**
   - Similar to Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression also shrinks the coefficients towards zero to prevent overfitting.
   - However, unlike Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression performs variable selection by setting some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively removing those features from the model.

#### Key Points:

- Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that introduces a penalty term to the least squares objective function to prevent overfitting and encourage sparsity.
- It is particularly useful for feature selection and dealing with high-dimensional datasets.
- The regularization parameter $\alpha$ controls the strength of the penalty, with larger values leading to greater shrinkage and sparsity.
- Lasso Regression can be used to automatically select the most relevant features while ignoring irrelevant ones.
