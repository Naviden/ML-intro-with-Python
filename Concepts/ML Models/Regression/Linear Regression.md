Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

#### How It Works:

1. **Simple Linear Regression:**
   - In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable (feature) that is used to predict the dependent variable.
   - The relationship between the independent variable (x) and dependent variable (y) is represented by a straight line equation:
     $$y = mx + b$$
     where:
     - $m$ is the slope of the line (the change in y for a unit change in x).
     - $b$ is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is zero).

2. **Multiple Linear Regression:**
   - In multiple linear regression, there are multiple independent variables (features) used to predict the dependent variable.
   - The relationship between multiple independent variables ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$) and the dependent variable (y) is represented by the equation:
     $$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n$$
     where:
     - $b_0$ is the intercept (the value of y when all independent variables are zero).
     - $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ are the coefficients (slopes) associated with each independent variable.

3. **Fitting the Model:**
   - The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.
   - This is typically done by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the actual and predicted values, known as the least squares method.

4. **Interpreting Coefficients:**
   - The coefficients ($b_0, b_1, ..., b_n$) in the linear regression equation represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
   - A positive coefficient indicates a positive relationship, meaning that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable also increases (and vice versa for negative coefficients).

#### Key Points:

- Linear regression models the relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable using a linear equation.
- Simple linear regression involves one independent variable, while multiple linear regression involves multiple independent variables.
- The coefficients in the regression equation represent the slope or effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.
- Linear regression is widely used for prediction, inference, and understanding the relationship between variables.
