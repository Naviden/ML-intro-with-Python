Ridge Regression is a variant of linear regression that addresses multicollinearity and overfitting by adding a penalty term to the standard least squares objective function. It is particularly useful when the feature space is high-dimensional or when there are correlated features.

#### How It Works:

1. **Objective Function:**
   - Ridge Regression modifies the standard linear regression objective function by adding a regularization term, also known as the Ridge penalty or L2 penalty.
   - The objective function for Ridge Regression is given by:
     $$\text{minimize } J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^{p} \theta_j^2$$
     where:
     - $J(\theta)$ is the cost function to be minimized.
     - $\theta_j$ are the regression coefficients.
     - $\hat{y}_i$ are the predicted values.
     - $\alpha$ is the regularization parameter (also known as the Ridge parameter).
     - The second term is the regularization term, penalizing large values of the coefficients $\theta_j$.

2. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:**
   - The Ridge penalty shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing the variance of the model at the cost of introducing some bias.
   - Increasing the value of $\alpha$ increases the regularization strength, leading to greater shrinkage of the coefficients and a simpler model.
   - Choosing an appropriate value of $\alpha$ is important to balance the tradeoff between bias and variance.

3. **Feature Scaling:**
   - It is important to scale the features before applying Ridge Regression to ensure that all features contribute equally to the penalty term.
   - Standardizing or normalizing the features to have mean zero and unit variance is a common practice.

#### Key Points:

- Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the least squares objective function to prevent overfitting.
- It is effective for handling multicollinearity and reducing the variance of the model.
- The regularization parameter $\alpha$ controls the strength of the penalty, with larger values leading to greater shrinkage of coefficients.
- Ridge Regression is suitable for high-dimensional datasets and situations where feature correlation is present.
