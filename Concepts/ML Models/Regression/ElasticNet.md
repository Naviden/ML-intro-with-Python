ElasticNet is a hybrid regularization technique that combines the penalties of both Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) and Lasso Regression (L1 regularization). It is used in linear regression to address multicollinearity, feature selection, and overfitting.

#### How It Works:

1. **Objective Function:**
   - ElasticNet modifies the standard linear regression objective function by adding a combination of L1 and L2 penalties to the least squares term.
   - The objective function for ElasticNet is given by:
     $$\text{minimize } J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \alpha \left( \lambda ||\theta||_1 + (1 - \lambda) ||\theta||_2^2 \right)$$
     where:
     - $J(\theta)$ is the cost function to be minimized.
     - $\theta$ are the regression coefficients.
     - $\hat{y}_i$ are the predicted values.
     - $\alpha$ is the regularization parameter that controls the overall strength of regularization.
     - $\lambda$ is the mixing parameter that controls the balance between L1 and L2 penalties.

2. **Balancing L1 and L2 Penalties:**
   - The mixing parameter $\lambda$ determines the balance between the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.
   - When $\lambda = 0$, ElasticNet reduces to Ridge Regression, and when $\lambda = 1$, it reduces to Lasso Regression.
   - Intermediate values of $\lambda$ allow for a mixture of L1 and L2 penalties, providing more flexibility in the regularization process.

3. **Feature Selection and Shrinkage:**
   - ElasticNet encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector by setting some coefficients to zero (similar to Lasso Regression).
   - It also shrinks the coefficients towards zero to prevent overfitting (similar to Ridge Regression).
   - The balance between feature selection and shrinkage is controlled by the mixing parameter $\lambda$.

#### Key Points:

- ElasticNet is a hybrid regularization technique that combines the penalties of Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression.
- It addresses multicollinearity, feature selection, and overfitting in linear regression models.
- The regularization parameters $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ control the overall strength of regularization and the balance between L1 and L2 penalties, respectively.
- ElasticNet is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with correlated features.
