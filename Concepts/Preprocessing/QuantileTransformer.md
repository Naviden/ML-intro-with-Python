Imagine we have a dataset with a single feature (e.g., scores from a test) as follows:

| Student | Score |
|---------|-------|
| A       | 20    |
| B       | 40    |
| C       | 60    |
| D       | 80    |
| E       | 100   |

## Goal

Our objective is to transform the `Score` feature so that it follows a uniform distribution across its range.

## Step 1: Rank the Values

First, we rank the scores from the smallest to the largest. In our simple case, the scores are already sorted:

- 20, 40, 60, 80, 100

These ranks help determine the quantiles of the data.

## Step 2: Apply the QuantileTransformer

The `QuantileTransformer` will transform the scores so that they are evenly spread out across the range. In a uniform distribution, each value is equally likely, and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is a straight line.

Let's say we want to map these scores to a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The transformation process involves:

1. Calculating the quantiles of the original data.
2. Mapping these quantiles to the corresponding quantiles of the uniform distribution.

## Step 3: Transforming Scores

Given our dataset has 5 scores, we can assign quantiles as follows (assuming a uniform distribution for simplicity):

- **A (20)**: Mapped to the 0.1 quantile of the uniform distribution.
- **B (40)**: Mapped to the 0.3 quantile.
- **C (60)**: Mapped to the 0.5 quantile.
- **D (80)**: Mapped to the 0.7 quantile.
- **E (100)**: Mapped to the 0.9 quantile.

This mapping ensures that the transformed data follows a uniform distribution.

## Transformed Dataset

After applying the `QuantileTransformer`, the dataset might look like this, assuming a straightforward linear interpolation for illustration:

| Student | Transformed Score |
|---------|-------------------|
| A       | 0.1               |
| B       | 0.3               |
| C       | 0.5               |
| D       | 0.7               |
| E       | 0.9               |
